    <h1>Air Force — Overview</h1>
    <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) (ISO: Bhāratīya Vāyu Senā) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflicts. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British India which honoured India's aviation service during World War II.

 The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF.[7] As of 1 January 2025, 135,000 personnel are in service with the Indian Air Force.[8][9] The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002, Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.</p>
